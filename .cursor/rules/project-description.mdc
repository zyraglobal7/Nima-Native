# 📋 **NIMA AI – Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### _AI Fashion Discovery & Personal Styling Platform_

**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)  
**Author:** Panel AI for Ian N.  
**Date:** January 2025

---

## 🎯 **1. Executive Summary**

### 1.1 Vision

Nima AI is a **Pinterest-meets-personal-stylist** platform where users become the model in every outfit they browse. Unlike generic search-based fashion tools (Google, ChatGPT), Nima goes deep into fashion discovery by combining AI virtual try-on technology, personalized styling, and optional concierge shopping—all wrapped in a visually immersive, scroll-worthy experience.

### 1.2 Why This Wins

The fashion discovery economy has shifted from "search" to "visual-first discovery" [S6]. Users don't want to type "beige formal pants"—they want to scroll, see themselves in outfits, and feel inspired. Zalando credited an **18% year-on-year profitability increase** partly from AI-driven discovery features [S11]. Apps like OneOff are positioning themselves as the "Spotify of Fashion" with personalization at every layer [S4].

**Nima's edge:** You ARE the model. Every outfit on your feed shows _you_ wearing it—not some random person. That's sticky, that's shareable, that's conversion gold.

## 👤 **2. Target Personas**

| Persona                      | Description                                                                        | Pain Points                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Scroll Sarah"**           | 22-35, loves Pinterest/TikTok, visual browser, buys on impulse if she can "see it" | Can't visualize herself in clothes; tired of returns     |
| **"Busy Bola"**              | 28-45, working professional, wants style without effort                            | No time to shop across multiple stores; wants it handled |
| **"Budget-Conscious Chris"** | 20-40, cares about price, compares before buying                                   | Needs to see prices upfront; wants value                 |
| **"International Ife"**      | Lives in a region where certain stores don't ship directly                         | Can't access items; needs someone to buy on their behalf |

## 🔄 **3. User Journey & Core Flows**

### 3.1 **Onboarding Flow** (First-Time User)

This is CRITICAL. Best practices say onboarding should be interactive, engaging, and hands-on from the start [S23]. Make it feel like a game, not a form.

**Flow Steps:**

| Step                      | What Happens                                                                                                                                                                      | Data Captured                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Welcome**            | AI stylist (Nima) greets user with personality: _"Hey there! I'm Nima, your personal stylist. Let's get you set up so I can show you YOUR best looks."_                        | —                                                       |
| **2. Style Vibe**         | Visual quiz: show 8-12 outfit images, user taps the ones they love (Pinterest-style). _"Tap outfits that make you say 'THAT'S me!'"_                                              | `style_preferences[]`                                   |
| **3. Size & Fit**         | Interactive body input: _"What's your usual t-shirt size? Waist? Don't worry, I won't judge."_ Dropdowns + illustrations                                                          | `shirt_size`, `waist_size`, `pants_size`, `shoe_size`   |
| **4. Location & Budget**  | _"Where are you based? And what's your vibe—thrift queen or treat yourself?"_                                                                                                     | `country`, `currency`, `budget_range` (Low/Mid/Premium) |
| **5. Photo Upload**       | _"Now for the fun part! Upload 2-4 photos of yourself so I can show you in every outfit."_ Clear instructions: full body, close-up, different angles. **Privacy note displayed.** | `user_photos[]` (stored securely)                       |
| **6. Account Creation**   | Email/Google sign-up. Frictionless.                                                                                                                                               | `email`, `auth_provider`                                |
| **7. Discovery Unlocked** | _"You're all set! Let's find your new favorite fits."_ → Redirect to main feed                                                                                                    | —                                                       |

**Pro Tips for MVP:**

- Use a progress bar (5 steps) to reduce drop-off [S23]
- Allow "Skip for now" on photos (degrade experience but don't block)
- Keep VTO load times under 7 seconds—users won't wait [S17]

---

### 3.2 **Main Feed (Discovery)**

A Pinterest-style masonry grid showing outfit cards. Each card displays the user as the model (via AI try-on).

**Feed Card Components:**

- **Outfit Image** (user wearing the outfit via AI generation)
- **Quick Save Heart** (tap to save)
- **Price Range Badge** (e.g., "$50-$120")
- **Style Tag** (e.g., "Casual Friday", "Date Night")

**Feed Algorithm Inputs:**

- Style preferences from onboarding
- Body measurements (to surface correct sizes)
- Budget range
- Past saves & engagement
- Seasonal/trending data

**Daily Limits (Free Tier):**
Based on competitor analysis [S43], free tiers typically limit:

- **15-25 outfit views/day** (with AI try-on)
- **Unlimited browse** (without try-on preview)
- **5 saves/day** to collections

---

### 3.3 **Collection/Wardrobe Feature**

#### 🎯 **Naming Decision: "Lookbooks"**

Ian, you asked about "Collections" vs "Wardrobes." Here's my take:

| Name             | Pros                                             | Cons                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Collections**  | Pinterest-familiar, broad                        | Overused, generic                              |
| **Wardrobes**    | Fashion-specific, tangible                       | Implies ownership (user doesn't own these yet) |
| **Closet**       | Very common (Acloset, Whering use it) [S31][S33] | Overused in space                              |
| **Lookbooks** ✅ | Fashion-forward, aspirational, implies curation  | Slightly longer word                           |
| **Boards**       | Pinterest exact                                  | Too derivative                                 |

**Recommendation:** **"Lookbooks"** — it's aspirational ("my summer lookbook"), fashion-native, and implies curation without implying ownership. Users save outfits to their lookbooks for later.

**Lookbook Features:**

- Create multiple lookbooks (e.g., "Summer Vacation", "Work Mode", "Date Night")
- Share lookbooks publicly (growth/viral feature)
- Collaborative lookbooks (invite friends to add)

---

### 3.4 **Outfit Detail View**

When user taps an outfit card:

| Section              | Content                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hero Image**       | Full outfit with user as model                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Nima's Note**      | AI-generated stylist comment: _"This earthy palette complements your skin tone beautifully. The relaxed fit keeps it effortless but the layering adds depth. You'd turn heads at brunch! 🔥"_ |
| **Products List**    | Each item in the outfit: image, name, brand, price, "Buy" link                                                                                                                                |
| **Total Price**      | Sum of all items                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Nima Shop Button** | (if available) "Let Nima Buy This For You"                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Similar Looks**    | Carousel of related outfits                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 3.5 **Nima Shop (Concierge Buying Service)**

#### 🎯 **Naming Options:**

| Name                 | Vibe                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Nima Buy             | Simple, clear                     |
| Nima Shop            | Feels like a service              |
| **Nima Delivers** ✅ | Action-oriented, promises outcome |
| Shop For Me          | Too generic                       |
| Personal Shopper     | Sounds expensive                  |

**Recommendation:** **"Nima Delivers"** or keep it simple with **"Shop For Me"**

**How It Works:**

1. User clicks "Nima Delivers" on an outfit
2. Sees breakdown: Item costs + Nima Service Fee (% or flat) + Estimated Shipping
3. Enters shipping address + payment
4. Nima's backend (or ops team initially) purchases items from stores
5. Items consolidated and shipped to user
6. User receives tracking + delivery

**Concierge services like Jetblack and Ship Out From USA have proven this model** [S37][S40]. It's especially valuable for international users who can't access certain stores directly.

**MVP Approach:**

- Start with **manual fulfillment** (you literally buy and ship)
- Charge **10-15% service fee** or **flat $10-20**
- Only offer for select countries/regions initially
- Track margins closely before automating

## 💰 **4. Monetization Model**

Freemium with multiple revenue streams is the most effective model in fashion tech [S1].

| Stream                     | Description                                                                | MVP?         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Freemium Subscriptions** | Free tier with limits; paid unlocks unlimited try-ons, saves, early access | ✅           |
| **Affiliate Commissions**  | Earn % when users click through and purchase                               | ✅           |
| **Nima Delivers Fee**      | Service fee on concierge purchases                                         | ✅           |
| **Seller Subscriptions**   | Brands/stores pay to be featured more prominently                          | ✅ (Phase 2) |
| **Promoted Outfits**       | Brands pay to have outfits surface higher in feeds                         | Phase 2      |
| **Data Insights**          | Sell anonymized trend data to brands                                       | Phase 3      |

### Subscription Tiers (Proposed)

| Tier           | Price     | Features                                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**       | $0        | 20 AI try-on views/day, 5 saves/day, ads                                                 |
| **Style Pass** | $7.99/mo  | Unlimited try-ons, unlimited saves, no ads, early access to drops                        |
| **VIP Closet** | $19.99/mo | All above + priority Nima Delivers, exclusive collabs, personal styling sessions (async) |

## 🧩 **9. Things You Might Have Missed**

Here are some additions I'd recommend:

| Feature                        | Why It Matters                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Why This Works" Tooltips**  | When Nima explains why an outfit suits the user (color theory, body shape), it builds trust and engagement |
| **Outfit Remixing**            | Let users swap one item in an outfit ("I like this but with different shoes")                              |
| **Price Drop Alerts**          | Notify users when items in saved outfits go on sale—high conversion                                        |

| **AI try-on quality issues**    | Start with waist-up or simple poses; set expectations in onboarding                |
| **Photo privacy concerns**      | Clear privacy policy; allow photo deletion; don't use for training without consent |
| **Low initial product catalog** | Seed with popular stores (Zara, H&M, ASOS); manual curation beats automation early |
| **Nima Delivers logistics**     | Start with ONE region/country; manual fulfillment to learn before scaling          |
| **High AI API costs**           | Cache try-on images; limit free tier aggressively                                  |
